NewerEMBW (Newer Evolution Mario Bros. Wii) is a NSMBW mod meant to be at least as big as NewerSMBW. It contains a few unique themes as well as bring back older ones and some Wii U ports.

This mod is currently in development process but a -Part 1 release- has been made in order to showcase what has been done so far and get some feedback.

This part 1 release contains worlds 1 to 6 and secret worlds A to D. Be aware that not every single level is finished in every world so for that reason some "under construction <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87e80316-789c-4b6e-8869-a0615d84659c" width="60" height="30"> barriers" have been put around to avoid you accessing those.
